\par \begin{minipage}[h]{\textwidth}{\footnotesize\textit{Notes:} The figure shows the distribution of FLFP rates for a set of Asian countries with data available below the provincial level. The sides of the box show the 25th and 75th percentiles, while the interior line indicates the median. The whiskers show the values farthest from the median but within 1.5 times the interquartile range. Countries are ordered by the median rate. I compute the rates for the smallest geographic unit available, often corresponding to a district, county, or municipality. Data from IPUMS and the Indian Census. Appendix \ref{ap_data} details the construction of the cross-country dataset.}\end{minipage}
