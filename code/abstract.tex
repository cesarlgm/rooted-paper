\noindent How does early exposure to labor markets affect women's work in adulthood? Using Indonesian data, I find strong and persistent effects from more prolonged exposure to high-female employment places, especially during the formative years between ages 6 and 15. My estimation strategy compares women who left their birthplace at different ages but now live in the same location. I find that women from high-female-employment areas have 5 percentage points higher employment than those from lower-employment regions, suggesting that about 23\% of the spatial inequality in women's work is passed to the next generation, likely through learning of birthplace gender norms. \vspace{5cm}
